== Userland assembly

Programs under `userland/arch/<arch>/` are examples of userland assembly programming.

This section will document ISA agnostic concepts, and you should read it first.

ISA specifics are covered at:

* <<x86-userland-assembly>> under link:userland/arch/x86_64/[], originally migrated from: https://github.com/cirosantilli/x86-assembly-cheat
* <<arm-userland-assembly>> originally migrated from https://github.com/cirosantilli/arm-assembly-cheat under:
** link:userland/arch/arm/[]
** link:userland/arch/aarch64/[]

Like other userland programs, these programs can be run as explained at: xref:userland-setup[xrefstyle=full].

As a quick reminder, the fastest setups to get started are:

* <<userland-setup-getting-started-natively>> if your host can run the examples, e.g. x86 example on an x86 host:
* <<userland-setup-getting-started-with-prebuilt-toolchain-and-qemu-user-mode>> otherwise

However, as usual, it is saner to build your toolchain as explained at: xref:qemu-user-mode-getting-started[xrefstyle=full].

The first examples you should look into are:

* add
** link:userland/arch/x86_64/add.S[]
** link:userland/arch/arm/add.S[]
** link:userland/arch/aarch64/add.S[]
* mov between register and memory
** link:userland/arch/x86_64/mov.S[]
** <<arm-mov-instruction>>
** <<arm-load-and-store-instructions>>
* addressing modes
** <<x86-addressing-modes>>
** <<arm-addressing-modes>>
* registers, see: xref:assembly-registers[xrefstyle=full]
* jumping:
** <<x86-control-transfer-instructions>>
** <<arm-branch-instructions>>
* SIMD
** <<x86-simd>>
** <<arm-simd>>

The add examples in particular:

* introduce the basics of how a given assembly works: how many inputs / outputs, who is input and output, can it use memory or just registers, etc.
+
It is then a big copy paste for most other data instructions.
* verify that the venerable ADD instruction and our assertions are working

Now try to modify modify the x86_64 add program to see the assertion fail:

....
LKMC_ASSERT_EQ(%rax, $4)
....

because 1 + 2 tends to equal 3 instead of 4.

And then watch the assertion fail:

....
./build-userland
./run --userland userland/arch/x86_64/add.S
....

with error message:

....
assert_eq_64 failed
val1 0x3
val2 0x4
error: asm_main returned 1 at line 8
....

and notice how the error message gives both:

* the actual assembly source line number where the failing assert was
* the actual and expected values

Other infrastructure sanity checks that you might want to look into include:

* link:userland/arch/empty.S[]
* `LKMC_FAIL` tests
** link:userland/arch/lkmc_assert_fail.S[]
* `LKMC_ASSERT_EQ` tests
** link:userland/arch/x86_64/lkmc_assert_eq_fail.S[]
** link:userland/arch/arm/lkmc_assert_eq_fail.S[]
** link:userland/arch/aarch64/lkmc_assert_eq_fail.S[]
* `LKMC_ASSERT_MEMCMP` tests
** link:userland/arch/x86_64/lkmc_assert_memcmp_fail.S[]
** link:userland/arch/arm/lkmc_assert_memcmp_fail.S[]
** link:userland/arch/aarch64/lkmc_assert_memcmp_fail.S[]

=== Assembly registers

After seeing an <<userland-assembly,ADD hello world>>, you need to learn the general registers:

* x86, see: xref:x86-registers[xrefstyle=full]
* arm
** link:userland/arch/arm/registers.S[]
* aarch64
** link:userland/arch/aarch64/registers.S[]
** link:userland/arch/aarch64/pc.S[]

Bibliography: <<armarm7>> A2.3 "ARM core registers".

==== ARMv8 aarch64 x31 register

Example: link:userland/arch/aarch64/x31.S[]

There is no X31 name, and the encoding can have two different names depending on the instruction:

* XZR: zero register:
** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42788696/why-might-one-use-the-xzr-register-instead-of-the-literal-0-on-armv8
** https://community.arm.com/processors/f/discussions/3185/wzr-xzr-register-s-purpose
* SP: stack pointer

To make things more confusing, some aliases can take either name, which makes them alias to different things, e.g. MOV accepts both:

....
mov x0, sp
mov x0, xzr
....

and the first one is an alias to ADD while the second an alias to <<arm-bitwise-instructions,ORR>>.

The difference is documented on a per instruction basis. Instructions that encode 31 as SP say:

....
if d == 31 then
  SP[] = result;
else
  X[d] = result;
....

And then those that don't say that, B1.2.1 "Registers in AArch64 state" implies the zero register:

____
In instruction encodings, the value 0b11111 (31) is used to indicate the ZR (zero register). This
indicates that the argument takes the value zero, but does not indicate that the ZR is implemented
as a physical register.
____

This is also described on <<armarm8>> C1.2.5 "Register names":

____
There is no register named W31 or X31.

The name SP represents the stack pointer for 64-bit operands where an encoding of the value 31 in the
corresponding register field is interpreted as a read or write of the current stack pointer. When instructions
do not interpret this operand encoding as the stack pointer, use of the name SP is an error.

The name XZR represents the zero register for 64-bit operands where an encoding of the value 31 in the
corresponding register field is interpreted as returning zero when read or discarding the result when written.
When instructions do not interpret this operand encoding as the zero register, use of the name XZR is an error
____

=== Floating point assembly

Keep in mind that many ISAs started floating point as an optional thing, and it later got better integrated into the main CPU, side by side with SIMD.

For this reason, there are sometimes multiple ways to do floating point operations in each ISA.

Let's start as usual with floating point addition + register file:

* arm
** <<arm-vadd-instruction>>
** <<arm-vfp-registers>>
* aarch64
** <<armv8-aarch64-fadd-instruction>>
** <<armv8-aarch64-floating-point-registers>>

=== SIMD assembly

Much like ADD for non-SIMD, start learning SIMD instructions by looking at the integer and floating point SIMD ADD instructions of each ISA:

* x86
** <<x86-sse-data-transfer-instructions,ADDPD>>
** <<x86-paddq-instruction>>
* arm
** <<arm-vadd-instruction>>
* aarch64
** <<armv8-aarch64-add-vector-instruction>>
** <<armv8-aarch64-fadd-instruction>>

Then it is just a huge copy paste of infinite boring details:

* <<x86-simd>>
* <<arm-simd>>

To debug these instructoins, you can see the register values in GDB with:

....
info registers float
....

or alternatively with register names (here the ARMv8 V0 register):

....
print $v0
....

as mentioned at:

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5429137/how-to-print-register-values-in-gdb/38036152#38036152
* https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/8992/floating-point-registers-on-arm/20623#20623

Bibliography: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1389712/getting-started-with-intel-x86-sse-simd-instructions/56409539#56409539

==== FMA instruction

Fused multiply add:

* x86: xref:x86-fma[xrefstyle=full]

Bibliography:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplyâ€“accumulate_operation
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FMA_instruction_set

Particularly important numerical analysis instruction, that is used in particular for;

* Dot product
* Matrix multiplication

FMA is so important that <<ieee-754>> specifies it with single precision drop compared to a separate add and multiply!

Micro-op fun: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28630864/how-is-fma-implemented

Historically, FMA instructions have been added relatively late to instruction sets.

=== User vs system assembly

By "userland assembly", we mean "the parts of the ISA which can be freely used from userland".

Most ISAs are divided into a system and userland part, and to running the system part requires elevated privileges such as <<ring0>> in x86.

One big difference between both is that we can run userland assembly on <<userland-setup>>, which is easier to get running and debug.

In particular, most userland assembly examples link to the C standard library, see: xref:userland-assembly-c-standard-library[xrefstyle=full].

Userland assembly is generally simpler, and a pre-requisite for <<baremetal-setup>>.

System-land assembly cheats will be put under: xref:baremetal-setup[xrefstyle=full].

=== Userland assembly C standard library

All examples except the <<freestanding-programs>> link to the C standard library.

This allows using the C standard library for IO, which is very convenient and portable across host OSes.

It also exposes other non-IO functionality that is very convenient such as `memcmp`.

The C standard library infrastructure is implemented in the common userland / baremetal source files:

* link:lkmc.c[]
* link:lkmc.h[]
* link:lkmc/aarch64.h[]
* link:lkmc/arm.h[]
* link:lkmc/x86_64.h[]

==== Freestanding programs

Unlike most our other assembly examples, which use the C standard library for portability, examples under `freestanding/` directories don't link to the C standard library.

As a result, those examples cannot do IO portably, and so they make raw system calls and only be run on one given OS, e.g. <<linux-system-calls>>.

Such executables are called freestanding because they don't execute the glibc initialization code, but rather start directly on our custom hand written assembly.

In order to GDB step debug those executables, you will want to use `--no-continue`, e.g.:

....
./run --arch aarch64 --userland userland/arch/aarch64/freestanding/linux/hello.S --gdb-wait
./run-gdb --arch aarch64 --no-continue --userland userland/arch/aarch64/freestanding/linux/hello.S
....

You are now left on the very first instruction of our tiny executable!

=== GCC inline assembly

Examples under `arch/<arch>/c/` directories show to how use inline assembly from higher level languages such as C:

* x86_64
** link:userland/arch/x86_64/inline_asm/inc.c[]
** link:userland/arch/x86_64/inline_asm/add.c[]
** link:userland/arch/x86_64/inline_asm/sqrt_x87.c[] Shows how to use the <<x86-x87-fpu-instructions>> from inline assembly. Bibliography: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6514537/how-do-i-specify-immediate-floating-point-numbers-with-inline-assembly/52906126#52906126
* arm
** link:userland/arch/arm/inline_asm/inc.c[]
** link:userland/arch/arm/inline_asm/inc_memory.c[]
** link:userland/arch/arm/inline_asm/inc_memory_global.c[]
** link:userland/arch/arm/inline_asm/add.c[]
* aarch64
** link:userland/arch/aarch64/inline_asm/earlyclobber.c[]
** link:userland/arch/aarch64/inline_asm/inc.c[]
** link:userland/arch/aarch64/inline_asm/multiline.cpp[]

==== GCC inline assembly register variables

Used notably in some of the <<linux-system-calls>> setups:

* link:userland/arch/arm/inline_asm/reg_var.c[]
* link:userland/arch/aarch64/inline_asm/reg_var.c[]
* link:userland/arch/aarch64/inline_asm/reg_var_float.c[]

In x86, makes it possible to access variables not exposed with the one letter register constraints.

In arm, it is the only way to achieve this effect: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10831792/how-to-use-specific-register-in-arm-inline-assembler

This feature notably useful for making system calls from C, see: xref:linux-system-calls[xrefstyle=full].

Documentation: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.4.2/gcc/Explicit-Reg-Vars.html

==== GCC inline assembly scratch registers

How to use temporary registers in inline assembly:

* x86_64
** link:userland/arch/x86_64/inline_asm/scratch.c[]
** link:userland/arch/x86_64/inline_asm/scratch_hardcode.c[]

Bibliography: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6682733/gcc-prohibit-use-of-some-registers/54963829#54963829

==== GCC inline assembly early-clobbers

An example of using the `&` early-clobber modifier: link:userland/arch/aarch64/earlyclobber.c

More details at: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15819794/when-to-use-earlyclobber-constraint-in-extended-gcc-inline-assembly/54853663#54853663

The assertion may fail without it. It actually does fail in GCC 8.2.0.

==== GCC inline assembly floating point ARM

Not documented as of GCC 8.2, but possible: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53960240/armv8-floating-point-output-inline-assembly

* link:userland/arch/arm/inline_asm/inc_float.c[]
* link:userland/arch/aarch64/inline_asm/inc_float.c[]

==== GCC intrinsics

Pre-existing C wrappers using inline assembly, this is what production programs should use instead of inline assembly for SIMD:

* x86_64
** link:userland/arch/x86_64/intrinsics/paddq.c[]. Intrinsics version of link:userland/arch/x86_64/paddq.S[]
** link:userland/arch/x86_64/intrinsics/addpd.c[]. Intrinsics version of link:userland/arch/x86_64/addpd.S[]

===== GCC x86 intrinsics

Good official cheatsheet with all intrinsics and what they expand to: https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide

The functions use the the following naming convention:

....
<vector_size>_<intrin_op>_<suffix>
....

where:

* `<vector_size>`:
** `mm`: 128-bit vectors (SSE)
** `mm256`: 256-bit vectors (AVX and AVX2)
** `mm512`: 512-bit vectors (AVX512)
* `<intrin_op>`: operation of the intrinsic function, e.g. add, sub, mul, etc.
* `<suffix>`: data type:
** `ps`: 4 floats (Packed Single)
** `pd`: 2 doubles (Packed Double)
** `ss`: 1 float (Single Single), often the lowest order one
** `sd`: 1 double (Single Double)
** `si128`: 128-bits of integers of any size
** `ep<int_type>` integer types, e.g.:
*** `epi32`: 32 bit signed integers
*** `epu16`: 16 bit unsigned integers

Data types:

* `__m128`: four floats
* `__m128d`: two doubles
* `__m128i`: integers: 8 x 16-bit, 4 x 32-bit, 2 x 64-bit

=== GNU GAS assembler

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Assembler[GNU GAS] is the default assembler used by GDB, and therefore it completely dominates in Linux.

The Linux kernel in particular uses GNU GAS assembly extensively for the arch specific parts under `arch/`.

==== GNU GAS assembler comments

In this tutorial, we use exclusively C Preprocessor `/**/` comments because:

* they are the same for all archs
* we are already stuck to the C Preprocessor because GNU GAS macros are unusable so we need `#define`
* mixing `#` GNU GAS comments and `#define` is a bad idea ;-)

But just in case you want to suffer, see this full explanation of GNU GAS comments: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15663280/how-to-make-the-gnu-assembler-use-a-slash-for-comments/51991349#51991349

Examples:

==== GNU GAS assembler immediates

Summary:

* x86 always dollar `$` everywhere.
* ARM: can use either `#`, `$` or nothing depending on v7 vs v8 and <<gnu-gas-assembler-arm-unified-syntax,`.syntax unified`>>.

===== GNU GAS assembler ARM specifics

====== GNU GAS assembler ARM unified syntax

There are two types of ARMv7 assemblies:

* `.syntax divided`
* `.syntax unified`

They are very similar, but unified is the new and better one, which we use in this tutorial.

Unfortunately, for backwards compatibility, GNU AS 2.31.1 and GCC 8.2.0 still use `.syntax divided` by default.

The concept of unified assembly is mentioned in ARM's official assembler documentation: http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0473c/BABJIHGJ.html and is often called Unified Assembly Language (UAL).

Some of the differences include:

* `#` is optional in unified syntax int literals, see <<gnu-gas-assembler-immediates>>
* many mnemonics changed:
** most of them are condition code position changes, e.g. ANDSEQ vs ANDEQS: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51184921/wierd-gcc-behaviour-with-arm-assembler-andseq-instruction
** but there are some more drastic ones, e.g. SWI vs <<arm-svc-instruction,SVC>>: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8459279/are-arm-instructuons-swi-and-svc-exactly-same-thing/54078731#54078731
* cannot have implicit destination with shift, see: xref:arm-shift-suffixes[xrefstyle=full]

===== GNU GAS assembler ARM .n and .w suffixes

When reading disassembly, many instructions have either a `.n` or `.w` suffix.

`.n` means narrow, and stands for the <<arm-instruction-encodings,Thumb encoding>> of an instructions, while `.w` means wide and stands for the ARM encoding.

Bibliography: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27147043/n-suffix-to-branch-instruction

==== GNU GAS assembler char literals

link:userland/arch/x86_64/char_literals.S[]

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33246811/how-to-use-character-literals-in-gnu-gas-to-replace-numbers

This syntax plays horribly with the C preprocessor:

....
MACRO($'a)
....

fails because cpp treats string and char literals magically.

=== NOP instructions

* x86: link:userland/arch/x86_64/nop.S[NOP]
* ARM: xref:arm-nop-instruction[xrefstyle=full]

No OPeration.

Does nothing except take up one processor cycle and occupy some instruction memory.
