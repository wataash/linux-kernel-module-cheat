== Graphics

Both QEMU and gem5 are capable of outputting graphics to the screen, and taking mouse and keyboard input.

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/307390/what-is-the-difference-between-ttys0-ttyusb0-and-ttyama0-in-linux

=== QEMU text mode

Text mode is the default mode for QEMU.

The opposite of text mode is <<qemu-graphic-mode>>

In text mode, we just show the serial console directly on the current terminal, without opening a QEMU GUI window.

You cannot see any graphics from text mode, but text operations in this mode, including:

* scrolling up: xref:scroll-up-in-graphic-mode[xrefstyle=full]
* copy paste to and from the terminal

making this a good default, unless you really need to use with graphics.

Text mode works by sending the terminal character by character to a serial device.

This is different from a display screen, where each character is a bunch of pixels, and it would be much harder to convert that into actual terminal text.

For more details, see:

* https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/307390/what-is-the-difference-between-ttys0-ttyusb0-and-ttyama0-in-linux
* <<tty>>

Note that you can still see an image even in text mode with the VNC:

....
./run --vnc
....

and on another terminal:

....
./vnc
....

but there is not terminal on the VNC window, just the <<config_logo>> penguin.

==== Quit QEMU from text mode

https://superuser.com/questions/1087859/how-to-quit-the-qemu-monitor-when-not-using-a-gui

However, our QEMU setup captures Ctrl + C and other common signals and sends them to the guest, which makes it hard to quit QEMU for the first time since there is no GUI either.

The simplest way to quit QEMU, is to do:

....
Ctrl-A X
....

Alternative methods include:

* `quit` command on the <<qemu-monitor>>
* `pkill qemu`

=== QEMU graphic mode

Enable graphic mode with:

....
./run --graphic
....

Outcome: you see a penguin due to <<config_logo>>.

For a more exciting GUI experience, see: xref:x11[xrefstyle=full]

Text mode is the default due to the following considerable advantages:

* copy and paste commands and stdout output to / from host
* get full panic traces when you start making the kernel crash :-) See also: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/208260/how-to-scroll-up-after-a-kernel-panic
* have a large scroll buffer, and be able to search it, e.g. by using tmux on host
* one less window floating around to think about in addition to your shell :-)
* graphics mode has only been properly tested on `x86_64`.

Text mode has the following limitations over graphics mode:

* you can't see graphics such as those produced by <<x11>>
* very early kernel messages such as `early console in extract_kernel` only show on the GUI, since at such early stages, not even the serial has been setup.

`x86_64` has a VGA device enabled by default, as can be seen as:

....
./qemu-monitor info qtree
....

and the Linux kernel picks it up through the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_framebuffer[fbdev] graphics system as can be seen from:

....
cat /dev/urandom > /dev/fb0
....

flooding the screen with colors. See also: https://superuser.com/questions/223094/how-do-i-know-if-i-have-kms-enabled

==== Scroll up in graphic mode

Scroll up in <<qemu-graphic-mode>>:

....
Shift-PgUp
....

but I never managed to increase that buffer:

* https://askubuntu.com/questions/709697/how-to-increase-scrollback-lines-in-ubuntu14-04-2-server-edition
* https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/346018/how-to-increase-the-scrollback-buffer-size-for-tty

The superior alternative is to use text mode and GNU screen or <<tmux>>.

==== QEMU Graphic mode arm

===== QEMU graphic mode arm terminal

TODO: on arm, we see the penguin and some boot messages, but don't get a shell at then end:

....
./run --arch aarch64 --graphic
....

I think it does not work because the graphic window is <<drm>> only, i.e.:

....
cat /dev/urandom > /dev/fb0
....

fails with:

....
cat: write error: No space left on device
....

and has no effect, and the Linux kernel does not appear to have a built-in DRM console as it does for fbdev with <<fbcon,fbcon>>.

There is however one out-of-tree implementation: <<kmscon>>.

===== QEMU graphic mode arm terminal implementation

`arm` and `aarch64` rely on the QEMU CLI option:

....
-device virtio-gpu-pci
....

and the kernel config options:

....
CONFIG_DRM=y
CONFIG_DRM_VIRTIO_GPU=y
....

Unlike x86, `arm` and `aarch64` don't have a display device attached by default, thus the need for `virtio-gpu-pci`.

See also https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/Platforms/ARM (recently edited and corrected by yours truly... :-)).

===== QEMU graphic mode arm VGA

TODO: how to use VGA on ARM? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20811203/how-can-i-output-to-vga-through-qemu-arm Tried:

....
-device VGA
....

But https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/v2.12.0/docs/config/mach-virt-graphical.cfg#L264 says:

....
# We use virtio-gpu because the legacy VGA framebuffer is
# very troublesome on aarch64, and virtio-gpu is the only
# video device that doesn't implement it.
....

so maybe it is not possible?

=== gem5 graphic mode

gem5 does not have a "text mode", since it cannot redirect the Linux terminal to same host terminal where the executable is running: you are always forced to connect to the terminal with `gem-shell`.

TODO could not get it working on `x86_64`, only ARM.

Overview: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50364863/how-to-get-graphical-gui-output-and-user-touch-keyboard-mouse-input-in-a-ful/50364864#50364864

More concretely, first build the kernel with the <<gem5-arm-linux-kernel-patches>>, and then run:

....
./build-linux \
  --arch arm \
  --custom-config-file-gem5 \
  --linux-build-id gem5-v4.15 \
;
./run --arch arm --emulator gem5 --linux-build-id gem5-v4.15
....

and then on another shell:

....
vinagre localhost:5900
....

The <<config_logo>> penguin only appears after several seconds, together with kernel messages of type:

....
[    0.152755] [drm] found ARM HDLCD version r0p0
[    0.152790] hdlcd 2b000000.hdlcd: bound virt-encoder (ops 0x80935f94)
[    0.152795] [drm] Supports vblank timestamp caching Rev 2 (21.10.2013).
[    0.152799] [drm] No driver support for vblank timestamp query.
[    0.215179] Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 240x67
[    0.230389] hdlcd 2b000000.hdlcd: fb0:  frame buffer device
[    0.230509] [drm] Initialized hdlcd 1.0.0 20151021 for 2b000000.hdlcd on minor 0
....

The port `5900` is incremented by one if you already have something running on that port, `gem5` stdout tells us the right port on stdout as:

....
system.vncserver: Listening for connections on port 5900
....

and when we connect it shows a message:

....
info: VNC client attached
....

Alternatively, you can also dump each new frame to an image file with `--frame-capture`:

....
./run \
  --arch arm \
  --emulator gem5 \
  --linux-build-id gem5-v4.15 \
  -- --frame-capture \
;
....

This creates on compressed PNG whenever the screen image changes inside the <<m5out-directory>> with filename of type:

....
frames_system.vncserver/fb.<frame-index>.<timestamp>.png.gz
....

It is fun to see how we get one new frame whenever the white underscore cursor appears and reappears under the penguin!

The last frame is always available uncompressed at: `system.framebuffer.png`.

TODO <<kmscube>> failed on `aarch64` with:

....
kmscube[706]: unhandled level 2 translation fault (11) at 0x00000000, esr 0x92000006, in libgbm.so.1.0.0[7fbf6a6000+e000]
....

Tested on: https://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-kernel-module-cheat/commit/38fd6153d965ba20145f53dc1bb3ba34b336bde9[38fd6153d965ba20145f53dc1bb3ba34b336bde9]

==== Graphic mode gem5 aarch64

For `aarch64` we also need to configure the kernel with link:linux_config/display[]:

....
git -C "$(./getvar linux_source_dir)" fetch https://gem5.googlesource.com/arm/linux gem5/v4.15:gem5/v4.15
git -C "$(./getvar linux_source_dir)" checkout gem5/v4.15
./build-linux \
  --arch aarch64 \
  --config-fragment linux_config/display \
  --custom-config-file-gem5 \
  --linux-build-id gem5-v4.15 \
;
git -C "$(./getvar linux_source_dir)" checkout -
./run --arch aarch64 --emulator gem5 --linux-build-id gem5-v4.15
....

This is because the gem5 `aarch64` defconfig does not enable HDLCD like the 32 bit one `arm` one for some reason.

==== gem5 graphic mode DP650

TODO get working. There is an unmerged patchset at: https://gem5-review.googlesource.com/c/public/gem5/+/11036/1

The DP650 is a newer display hardware than HDLCD. TODO is its interface publicly documented anywhere? Since it has a gem5 model and https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.19/drivers/gpu/drm/arm/Kconfig#L39[in-tree Linux kernel support], that information cannot be secret?

The key option to enable support in Linux is `DRM_MALI_DISPLAY=y` which we enable at link:linux_config/display[].

Build the kernel exactly as for <<graphic-mode-gem5-aarch64>> and then run with:

....
./run --arch aarch64 --dp650 --emulator gem5 --linux-build-id gem5-v4.15
....

==== Graphic mode gem5 internals

We cannot use mainline Linux because the <<gem5-arm-linux-kernel-patches>> are required at least to provide the `CONFIG_DRM_VIRT_ENCODER` option.

gem5 emulates the http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0541c/CHDBAIDI.html[HDLCD] ARM Holdings hardware for `arm` and `aarch64`.

The kernel uses HDLCD to implement the <<drm>> interface, the required kernel config options are present at: link:linux_config/display[].

TODO: minimize out the `--custom-config-file`. If we just remove it on `arm`: it does not work with a failing dmesg:

....

So what other options are missing from `gem5_defconfig`? It would be cool to minimize it out to better understand the options.

[[x11]]
=== X11 Buildroot

Once you've seen the `CONFIG_LOGO` penguin as a sanity check, you can try to go for a cooler X11 Buildroot setup.

Build and run:

....
./build-buildroot --config-fragment buildroot_config/x11
./run --graphic
....

Inside QEMU:

....
startx
....

And then from the GUI you can start exciting graphical programs such as:

....
xcalc
xeyes
....

Outcome: xref:image-x11[xrefstyle=full]

[[image-x11]]
.X11 Buildroot graphical user interface screenshot
[link=x11.png]
image::x11.png[]

We don't build X11 by default because it takes a considerable amount of time (about 20%), and is not expected to be used by most users: you need to pass the `-x` flag to enable it.

More details: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/70931/how-to-install-x11-on-my-own-linux-buildroot-system/306116#306116

Not sure how well that graphics stack represents real systems, but if it does it would be a good way to understand how it works.

To x11 packages have an `xserver` prefix as in:

....
./build-buildroot --config-fragment buildroot_config/x11 -- xserver_xorg-server-reconfigure
....

the easiest way to find them out is to just list `"$(./getvar buildroot_build_build_dir)/x*`.

TODO as of: c2696c978d6ca88e8b8599c92b1beeda80eb62b2 I noticed that `startx` leads to a <<bug_on>>:

....
[    2.809104] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 51 at drivers/gpu/drm/ttm/ttm_bo_vm.c:304 ttm_bo_vm_open+0x37/0x40
....

==== X11 Buildroot mouse not moving

TODO 9076c1d9bcc13b6efdb8ef502274f846d8d4e6a1 I'm 100% sure that it was working before, but I didn't run it forever, and it stopped working at some point. Needs bisection, on whatever commit last touched x11 stuff.

* https://askubuntu.com/questions/730891/how-can-i-get-a-mouse-cursor-in-qemu
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19665412/mouse-and-keyboard-not-working-in-qemu-emulator

`-show-cursor` did not help, I just get to see the host cursor, but the guest cursor still does not move.

Doing:

....
watch -n 1 grep i8042 /proc/interrupts
....

shows that interrupts do happen when mouse and keyboard presses are done, so I expect that it is some wrong either with:

* QEMU. Same behaviour if I try the host's QEMU 2.10.1 however.
* X11 configuration. We do have `BR2_PACKAGE_XDRIVER_XF86_INPUT_MOUSE=y`.

`/var/log/Xorg.0.log` contains the following interesting lines:

....
[    27.549] (II) LoadModule: "mouse"
[    27.549] (II) Loading /usr/lib/xorg/modules/input/mouse_drv.so
[    27.590] (EE) <default pointer>: Cannot find which device to use.
[    27.590] (EE) <default pointer>: cannot open input device
[    27.590] (EE) PreInit returned 2 for "<default pointer>"
[    27.590] (II) UnloadModule: "mouse"
....

The file `/dev/inputs/mice` does not exist.

Note that our current link:kernel_confi_fragment sets:

....
# CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSE is not set
# CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV_PSAUX is not set
....

for gem5, so you might want to remove those lines to debug this.

==== X11 Buildroot ARM

On ARM, `startx` hangs at a message:

....
vgaarb: this pci device is not a vga device
....

and nothing shows on the screen, and:

....
grep EE /var/log/Xorg.0.log
....

says:

....
(EE) Failed to load module "modesetting" (module does not exist, 0)
....

A friend told me this but I haven't tried it yet:

* `xf86-video-modesetting` is likely the missing ingredient, but it does not seem possible to activate it from Buildroot currently without patching things.
* `xf86-video-fbdev` should work as well, but we need to make sure fbdev is enabled, and maybe add some line to the `Xorg.conf`
